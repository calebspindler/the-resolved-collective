We are a community resolved in a journey to greater wellness through a lifestyle of nutrition, exercise, and essential oils. We work and act together in creating toxin-free homes, healthy families, and a more natural way of living.

Our group is comprised of young professionals and stay-at-home moms. We are based in Louisville, Kentucky, but stretch all over the US, sharing our collective stories and encouraging each other to live our best life now.

This site is home to all the resources dedicated to helping others join the collective and continue the journey. The contributors of these resources range across the spectrum of specialties: fitness professionals, nutritionists, nurses, to all-around information junkies, all committed to the same values.

Melanie Do
@melaniedo.eo

I am passionate about helping others awaken to their potential, see their value, and live empowered. I was born and raised in Arizona and currently live in the south-end of Louisville, KY with my husband, Kha, and my son, Ellis.

I have been using Young Living oils since 2013 when my at-the-time boyfriend (now husband) started rubbing lavender and peppermint on my face to soothe my mind. In 2015 I became fully committed to everything Young Living and started my oils business!

I have my Masters Degree in Counseling and am currently teaching classes at my local Barre3 studio, where I love to help people become balanced in body and empowered from within. I love using my essential oils to calm my mind and strengthen my body, using oils for anything from immune support to getting my baby to calm down and go to sleep! You will always find me with a Valor essential oil and a grapefruit lip balm in my purse.
