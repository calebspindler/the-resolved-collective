We have a growing a community. When you join as a MEMBER, you will receive a
welcome package with resources to start your journey. You will also receive
exclusive access to our collective resources and be added to our facebook
group and online community. There is NO PRESSURE to sell. You can join simply
to enjoy your oils and learn from this beautiful community.

Starting is simple, just enroll as a MEMBER by clicking on the team member
that has been sharing about oils with you below this page or just click HERE.



We recommend purchasing the Premium Starter Kit ($165) and picking an Essential Rewards Kit. Choose the WHOLESALE option to get the whole prices on your order.

This does NOT mean you will ever have to sell anything. It just means as a WHOLESALE member you get 24% off prices!﻿

Nevertheless, we stand behind Young Living’s products, so both options are great.

**Choose What Works Best For You!**


**OPTION ONE | Wholesale Customer (recommended)**

-No renewal fee; simply purchase a minimum of $50pv of product per year and your account stays active.
-No order minimum – order whenever you like, as often as you like at 24% off retail prices.
-There is no pressure to sell oils when you sign up. YL refers to wholesale members as “distributors” but that simply means that you receive distributor prices.
-You’ll also receive a member number to share with friends; if they order using your member number, YL thanks you for sharing by sending you compensation for the referral!


**OPTION TWO | Retail Customer**

-There is no starter kit required.
-Order products whenever you would like (but pay 24% more than a wholesale customer).

Also, consider choosing an Essential Rewards Kit:



Consider Choosing an Essential Rewards Kit: When checking out with your starter kit, you can select “no thank you” for the ER or choose a package and ship them together for extra savings. This is like any other Rewards Program for frequent buyers. Chances are, you’ll be coming back for more, and you won’t regret taking advantage of savings now. You can also customize your own, which we recommend! For every purchase you get 10-20% back in points each month, which you can redeem to purchase products (shampoo, vitamins, toothpaste, cleaning supplies, oils, makeup and more). Remember, you can cancel anytime.﻿
