In 2017, I graduated from the Institute of Integrative Nutrition and became a Certified Health Coach, focusing on lifestyle changes and nutritional theories. I have been able to use my own personal testimony of weight loss (100+ pounds) to become a leader in showing others that weight loss doesn’t come from a lotion, potion or pill, but through quality nutrition, exercise, and chiropractic care at Middletown Family Chiropractic in Louisville, KY. My passion is to show others that true health is attainable by simple lifestyle changes.

**Here are her top 10 favorite YL products:**

1. Cool Azul Pain Relief Cream for muscle and joint aches and pains
2. Stress away for the hard days and days that need a little extra relaxation
3. Lemon essential oil for getting out the smell from whatever I’ve been meal prepping
4. Seedlings Baby Wipes! Even though I’m not a mama I still have lots of uses for these. Makeup remover, dryer sheets (my fave), quick cleanup after the gym.
5. Mirah Hair oil. I actually don’t use it for my hair but it is the BEST after shave oil. I haven’t had any razor bumps in so long! This stuff is hands down on of my all time favorite products.
6. ART 3 step facial care for keeping my skin its best.
7. Eucalyptus for diffusing. I love the smell and it makes my home feel and smell so clean.
8. Thieves Cleaner! I use it for all things cleaning. It was my first young living purchase and is a constant in my home.
9. Thieves Fruit and Veggie Wash. I rely on this so much to get the toxic chemicals and dirt off my food. It smells great and does a great job at removing impurities.
10. Desert Mist Difuser. It’s beautiful and looks great in any room.
