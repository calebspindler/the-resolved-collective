Hello! I am a wife, momma, nurse, and pursuer of holistic wellness! I love caring for others and giving them the tools they need to make themselves and their families healthy! I live in San Diego with my husband, Caleb and 3 year old, Theo. Most days you can find me drinking coffee, cooking new recipes, and being outside with my sweet family. I started using Young Living in 2018 and fell in love with the benefits of the products for both body and mind. It has really been the best avenue for getting rid of toxins in our home and replacing them with something natural!

**Here is Kayla’s List of Young Living Favorites**:

* Cool Azul

  * This is my favorite product. It’s so soothing to aching muscles, tired feet, and swollen joints. It’s basically a natural ICY HOT cream, except SO much better. I use it after working out, after a chiropractic visit or massage, and anytime I have injured myself (strains & sprains).
* Lime Vitality Oil

  * This is my favorite vitality oil. We use it in guacamole, salsa, and make a mean vinaigrette with it. We use 2-3 drops in the place of a juiced lime.
* Stress Away

  * I use this every day as a stress reliever and a perfume. It smells amazing and brings calming vibes with it all day.
* Joy

  * I love diffusing Joy because it really uplifts a room. If I am in a funk, or it’s rainy, it can really make all the difference in my mood. AND it smells so good! I like to add a drop or two of Coriander with it because I think it sweetens it up even more.
* Cinnamon Lip Balm

  * Makes your lips have that good ‘tingle’ and makes them so soft! I put it on before bed and wake up to very soft lips.
* Savvy Mineral Foundation

  * I love how light and airy this foundation is, and that you can layer it to create the desired color. I also noticed that I didn’t have a problem this year when summer came and I got tanner. ( Usually I had to get a different foundation for summer). This one was so forgiving, I have used it all year!
* Oregano

  * I love science, and there is a lot of science to back up the most useful properties of oregano oil. I diffuse this when someone in my family is sick so the germs stay at bay and the air is cleansed. I also dilute it and put it on the bottom of our feet.
* Cedarwood

  * We use this every night on our pillows. It is so relaxing, especially along with lavender.. Promotes great sleep hygiene.
* Thieves Cleaner

  * This is arguably the most cost effective product that Young Living has. I use it to clean everything and it’s so effective! It’s a concentrated cleaner that is all natural and less than [$1](https://www.facebook.com/#) a bottle. I like to put an extra drop of lemon oil in the bottle for an extra “oomph”.
* Digize

  * This is your digestive oil. I have had some tummy issues and food sensitivities in the past It’s so helpful or calming the stomach and soothing the whole digestive system.
* Christmas Spirit Blend

  * Yes, this is for Christmas technically, but I use it in all the cold months and all the fall/winter holidays. It smells like going to grandma’s house and her surprising you with an apple pie as you walk in the door.
* Acceptance

  * This is an oil I use over my heart or on the inside of my wrists. It’s very calming and uplifting at the same time. It makes me feel overall more positive.
