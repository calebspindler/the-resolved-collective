HELLO, and WELCOME to the new Resolved Collective website! I wanted this first blog to be the red-ribbon cutting. It has been an honor and privilege for me to work on this project with such amazing women, with the help of our husbands and friends, and the patience of our children (and cats üòâ ). When I began dreaming years ago about what this group would look like, I never imagined that there would be 5 women standing with me, encouraging me towards health, well-being, and a thriving life.

I remember it was the summer of 2014, when I got my first essential oils kit after living the skeptic life. I would make fun of my at-that-time boyfriend who carried bottles of peppermint and lavender oil. After getting my kit, I knew it would become a big part of my life. I just didn‚Äôt know how big. I remember teaching my first oils class and asking my friends and family to attend. Look at the fear in my eyes!

When I lived in Arizona, I had the support of my leaders and the community there, but when I moved to Louisville, KY, so my husband could attend school there, suddenly I found myself alone wishing there was a similar support network I had in Arizona.

When I first started dreaming about the Resolved Collective, before it became the community that it is, all I knew was that I wanted to belong somewhere. I wanted to belong to a group of diverse people, in my city, and I wanted all of us to have similar passion for life. I knew that I wanted us to be proud of our vision, and that we would be supportive and loving, all the while pursuing our different goals in our unique ways. We would be UNIFIED, but not UNIFORM.

After having met Leah, Julia, Luanne, Kayla, and Rachel, I knew that this was it. This was my tribe, my group, my collective. These were the people I wanted to live my life alongside, be challenged by, and learn from. Most of this happened over coffee, living rooms, or the yoga studio and discovering each other‚Äôs interest in health, fitness, essential oils, and being our own boss. Each woman completed another piece of the collective with their various backgrounds, goals, families, and styles of living. The one thing that all of us had in common was our determination to reach our goals and finding natural solutions. We started meeting monthly to share these goals and visions, and whatever life hacks we‚Äôve been trying. Then we decided, what if we expanded our community to invite others in to this conversation. What if there was a central place for all of these conversations, and resources, and training material for others in similar situations. We wanted to create a place not just for mentoring for other business builders, but a safe community to ask ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù questions, learn together, and hold each other accountable. Starting your journey doesn‚Äôt have to be lonely like mine.And the Resolved Collective was born.

The word ‚Äúresolved‚Äù has the ability to be an adjective and a verb; both action and descriptor. We chose this word because we wanted our collective of people to be both people of action and substance. To be described as one living Resolved is to live firmly determined to do something. And to be Resolved in life is to find a solution to a problem or settle a problem. And let‚Äôs be real, there are a lot of problems in this world and we need more people who are determined to do something about them.

In our own lives we live resolved, and we are also there to help others resolve their problems by sharing our collective knowledge. Whether it be health, emotions, hormones, living toxin-free, or raising their families. I love our little wonderful family, is all that I hoped for and more. We are all so passionate about cultivating wellness in our lives, and we desire nothing less for others.

It is my hope that you will find this same passion and dedication to living healthy and full lives. Cheers to Living Resolved!
