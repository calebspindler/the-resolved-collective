I am passionate about loving on and supporting mamas in all stages. Through TTC, miscarriage, pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, postpartum, and mom life- I’m here for you.

I was raised in Norman, Oklahoma and attended Baylor University in Texas. I now live in Louisville, Kentucky with my high school sweetheart husband and our three beautiful, crazy babies- all 18 months apart. I was first interested in essential oils for the skin care benefits but quickly learned that they are good for so much more!

I am so thankful for these little bottles and all they do for my family. My kids haven’t been to the doctor aside from well visits (and the occasional injury or asthma attack) since starting to use oils over three years ago and my youngest two have never been on antibiotics or prescriptions of any kind. Sharing this life of wellness that comes from these golden drops brings me great joy and it’s an honor to walk this path with you.

Here is Julia’s list of top Young Living Products:

* Single oils: Orange, Lime, Bergamot (uplifting, calming, smells amazing!!), Lemongrass (purifying), Cedar wood (sleep), Rosemary, Copaiba (great for baby gums), Tangerine, Grapefruit, Jade Lemon.
* Blends: Joy (floral), Purification (purifying), Dreamcatcher (a splurge for sleep but one of my all time favorites!), Release, Acceptance, Christmas Spirit, Gentle Baby, R.C (respiratory care- I haven’t used cold medicine in years! Similar to Raven), White Angelica (grief, big emotions, stress)
* Ningxia Red antioxidant drink (we all drink this everyday for immune support and overall health)
* Thieves cleaner, Thieves laundry soap, Thieves dish soap, Thieves foaming hand soap
* Seedlings baby wash, Seedlings baby lotion (we all use this!)
* Charcoal bar soap (for face), Lavender lip balm, Copaiba vanilla shampoo/conditioner, Thieves aromabright toothpaste, Lavender oatmeal bar soap, Orange blossom facial wash, Savvy minerals makeup line, Supplements (vitamins infused with essential oils make them more easily absorbed)
