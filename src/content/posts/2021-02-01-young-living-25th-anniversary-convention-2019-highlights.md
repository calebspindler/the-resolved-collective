“Know your roots.” That was one of many mantras repeated at this year’s YL Convention. With over 40,000 attenders, the largest attendance in YL history, our company, which began with a humble farmer, celebrated 25 years of growth. “Before we look to the future, we look at our past.” The week felt like a family reunion as it always does, full of old slideshows, reminiscing, traditions, and the “family talk” where we look to what’s ahead. We laughed, we cried, we celebrated the life of D. Gary Young and his vision realized as the essential oils industry is stronger than ever. While there are many players in the game, Young Living stands alone with its history and uncompromising commitment to quality. We saw brand new products, welcomed new farms into the family, took a leap into space? (more on that), and gave millions back to the world. Here are some highlights:

## Nature’s Ultra + YL CBD Oil

That’s right, Dr. Michael Buch, Young Living Chief Officer of Science, revealed that Young Living is now the first essential oils company to go to space! In his own words,

*I announced our partnership with NASA and the International Space Station last evening. We are studying the effects of radiation in space on seeds and oils to gain an understanding of how solar radiation effects our seeds, plants and oils here on earth. The oils and seeds that we are sending on this launch, will be on the international space station for a month and then returned to earth so our scientists can study them. We can proudly say we are the first essential oil company to partner with NASA.\
The launch was originally scheduled for Sunday but NASA has rescheduled it for Wed, July 24th. You can watch it live at this level link:* [https://www.rocketlaunch.live/launch/crs-spx-18](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketlaunch.live%2Flaunch%2Fcrs-spx-18%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1khsSevwYOB0crkXLmUb3s8nW6jAcUUAOdaRVDmfbp72Ybf0qGbrr48Mc&h=AT1OI5xeOwZvjjS8AzBwRiPtbVjPGF6fA2hgcwawi6TaCDtt4QiEu_v5692YKUc7UKT_xd0iuUPwg9wCASR-pfw1JpsRgrJnUBaNHoluq8ekGN7UI3MSAodIq64DuWivtP8iHLA2FufZ86oiLpAKYvGDPgK3)

## Keynote Speaker: John C. Maxwell

![](/assets/john-maxwell-headshot.webp)

With 82 published books on leadership and success, John C. Maxwell was a heavyweight on the list of annual convention speakers. He was winsome and wise, challenging and encouraging, and a wealth of mantras. Some of his memorable quotes included:

***People won’t go along with you if they don’t get along with you…***

***Everything worthwhile is uphill***.

***Dreams are free but the journey isn’t***.

***Failure is not the opposite of success. It is the process to success.***

**\*Value yesterday but live in today**.*

***The guarantee for tomorrow is that you are growing today***.
