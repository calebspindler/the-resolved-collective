Having a hard time getting motivated for your early morning workout? We’ve all been there. As a fitness instructor I know that you cannot rely on motivation alone to reach your goals. Your motivation and feelings come and go. In the end, it’s habits and routines that get you off the pillow and into the gym. Here’s my recommended regimen to get the body warmed up for the gym, as well a cool down routine to help those muscles recover.

## Warm Up Routine

Set your alarm 3 minutes earlier. Once it goes off, no snoozing, just sit up in bed, and do some light stretches to wake up the body. Ignite your senses with some **Lemongrass** essential oil first thing. I keep it on the nightstand ready to go. Place one drop on each wrist and rub them together and also, place a drop or two on your belly right above the navel to really wake up the mid-body! Lemongrass will work hard to give you that pick-me-up you’re needing.

For the later in the day workouts, **Peppermint** is your go-to! This oil has a cooling sensation that can help you feel lively in seconds. Inhale this oil by rubbing a drop in your palms and holding them up to your nose before you begin your workout or place a drop on each wrist and rub it in as well as applying a few to the back of the neck and shoulders to relieve the tension before you smash your workout. Pro Tip: Avoid the eyes with peppermint as it is a lil spicy! #feelingalive

## Cool Down Routine

Alright! So you just crushed that workout. Now it’s time to thank those muscles with a little cool down. Let me introduce you to **Panaway,** my one true post-workout love. This oil is like a massage in a bottle. It is a blend of all things cooling, refreshing, and rejuvenating and it targets wounded muscles and helps bring them back to life. When that certain muscle is just SCREAMING at you, take a drop or two of Panaway and give yourself a good, tough love! My other post-workout bff is going to be **Cool Azul**, which is pretty much the older sister to Panaway. Cool Azul is an over-the-counter certified lotion blend that will be great for that after-shower massage, or even right before bed. You can’t go wrong with either of these!!!
